    </p>

    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
    <ul><b>Osmanthus Syrup (optional)

    <li>250 g golden granulated sugar</li>
    <li>125ml water</li> 
    <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>1
    <li>8 g dried osmanthus flowers</li>
    <p></p>

    Xingren Doufu

    <li>75 g blanched almonds</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp agar agar powder (2g)</li>
    <li>1/8 tsp almond extract</li>
    <li>40 g golden granulated sugar</li>
    <li>4 tbsp osmanthus syrup + extra (see above)</li></b>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>To make the Osmanthus Syrup, add the sugar, water and salt to a saucepan and bring to a simmer. Stir until all the sugar is dissolved, then add the omsanthus flowers and turn off the heat.
             Let it cool for 10 minutes, then pour the mixture into a clean jar. 
            Once it’s cooled down entirely, you can use it immediately, but it’ll develop a richer flavour over the next days. Keep refrigerated and use within 2-3 weeks.</li>
        
        <li>To make the Xingren Doufu, soak the almonds in at least 300ml water overnight.</li>
        <li>The next day, drain and rinse them, then add to a blender along with 500ml of fresh water and blend well. 
            Strain the liquid through a muslin cloth and squeeze out as much milk as possible. You can use the leftover pulp in your müsli.</li>
        <li>Add the milk to a small saucepan, whisk in the agar agar powder and let it soak for 5 minutes. 
            Turn on the heat and slowly bring it to a boil, then simmer for 5 minutes, whisking constantly to prevent it from boiling over and to allow the agar agar to dissolve entirely. 
            Stir in the almond extract and sugar and whisk for a little longer until dissolved as well, then turn off the heat.</li>
        <li>Pour the mixture into a mould, skim off any foam from the surface, then leave it to cool and refrigerate for 1 hour or until set.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, dissolve the omsanthus syrup in 160ml water, strain the liquid into a bowl and set aside.</li>
        <li>Remove the doufu from the mould and cut it into 2 cm pieces. Divide the pieces over bowls, top them with the osmanthus water and an extra drizzle of the syrup and serve.</li>
